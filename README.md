# About TimeVaultAI
This is my first project on GitHub, made entirely with ChatGPT, its a simple website allowing you to create a Journal with photos, videos and audio messages.

Its objective should be creating a storyline for your whole life by updating this "Journal" daily. This is an MVP of the main project. This DOES NOT work. I'm still learning how to correctly use ChatGPT and right now its doing 100% of the work and its showing. Please be kind with me.
